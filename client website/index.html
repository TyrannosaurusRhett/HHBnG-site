				<p>Here Be Books & Games is your best local source and resource for board games in the greater Charleston area. Located in Summerville, South Carolina, this customer service oriented board game shop and gaming salon has been in operation for 15 years!</p>

				<p>Our purpose is to help people engage with each other, face-to-face, playing tabletop games and assembling puzzles. We love to help our customers find the perfect game for themselves or for others, according to their particular tastes, desired playing time, skill level, and usual number of players. Unlike most online game stores, you can call us during our scheduled business hours and talk with a live person who is knowledgeable about the subject. We’re happy to make recommendations, take requests and pre-orders, and otherwise assist you.</p>

				<p>Local gamers in Summerville, South Carolina and the surrounding Berkeley, Charleston, Dorchester county areas can take advantage of our Game Nights and other gaming events and are always welcome to come in for a demo or to learn a new game. We’ll even teach you how to play!</p>

				<p>Our collection of used and out of print books is also an excellent resource for people looking to disengage from electronics. They are all listed online so that you can browse the titles at your leisure. If you find something there that you like, call or email us so that we can pull the titles for you.</p>

				<p>We are dedicated to maintaining and enhancing our customers’ satisfaction by leveraging technology and providing exceptional service in a friendly, relaxed atmosphere.</p>
