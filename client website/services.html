				<h2>Serving You</h2>

				<p>We get it. The world is crazy and life is busy, but that’s why we exist. Here Be Books & Games is dedicated to a relaxed and welcoming atmosphere both for dedicated gaming veterans and complete newbies who’ve never heard of a meeple before.</p>

				<h3>Game Night</h3>

				<figure class="right">

				</figure>

				<p>This is the big one! On the first Saturday of every month (Yes, including holidays) from 2pm to after midnight we host a big gaming meetup for people to come in and play some games. People will often bring their own games from home, so it’s an excellent way to try out and learn new games while meeting and having fun with new people.</p>

				<p>The cost of admission is $7.50 per person, and there are drinks and snacks available for purchase. No reservation necessary. Just show up and come inside, ready to play!</p>

				<h3>Mid-Week Gaming</h3>

				<p>A great way to fight off those middle of the week blues! Come visit us Wednesday during regular store hours to play some games free of charge. This is a great opportunity to learn a new game so that you can be ready to go with it before the big Game Night. That way you don’t have to waste time figuring things out with other players who might be just as unfamiliar with the game. Tim and Tina are very experienced gamers and always ready to help new people learn.</p>

				<h3>In-Store Gaming Events</h3>

				<p>International Tabletop Day? Board Game Auctions? Demo-play of new and upcoming games?</p>

				<p>Yes, we have all of that going on too! These are all free to attend events that we organize and host right in the store, and we invite you to join us for them. Since none of these events have dates that are set in stone, the best way to keep up to date on what’s happening is to check out our monthly newsletter. It will let you know about any major upcoming events as well as reviews, recommendations, and general gaming news.</p>

				<h3>Sci-fi & Fantasy Book Club</h3>

				<p>Even as we’ve moved our focus away from from being a book shop, we’ve never lost our love of reading. Here we read fantasy and science fiction books, including urban fantasy and alternate history, and once we’re done, we meet and talk about them. Books are suggested by club members and put on a list. We work our way entirely through that list before beginning again with a new one, so you will have direct input in what gets read. No fees to join. Just read the book and show up to the meeting prepared to discuss.</p>

				<p>If that sounds interesting to you, come check out our <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/herebebookclub/" target="_blank">Facebook Group</a> to keep updated about when we’re meeting and what we’re reading.</p>
