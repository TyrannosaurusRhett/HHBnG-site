				<p>We’ve recently stocked an entire wall full of jigsaw puzzles of varying difficulty levels. There are puzzles for children who are just getting into the hobby and some more challenging fare for experienced puzzlers. You can choose from a variety of piece-counts, shaped puzzles, mini puzzles, and even double-sided puzzles.</p>

				<p>If you're feeling up for a challenge, be sure to check out the <a href="https://herebebooksandgames.com/onlinestore/326-wickedly-hard-puzzles" target="_blank">Wickedly Hard</a> category in our shop. We've got you covered too, and be sure to check back frequently, as we're constantly getting new items in stock.</p>

				<h2>Roleplaying Games, Dice & Accessories</h2>

				<p>It is a well-known fact that roleplayers love buying new dice sets whether they need them or not. Hint: You always need them. We have more shiny math rocks that you can add to your collection.</p>

				<p>And while you’re doing that, you can also check out our roleplaying game bookcase. It’s shelves are stocked with current and past editions of popular and somewhat obscure roleplaying source books. The drawers at the bottom are stuffed with their own treasures as well: adventure modules, character packets, and more.</p>
