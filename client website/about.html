				<h2>About Us</h2>

				<p>Here Be Books & Games is as much a business as a labor of love owned and operated by Tim and Tina McDuffie. They are lifelong lovers of reading and, of course, gaming, and it has been since their earliest days as a couple that the pair dreamed of owning a used-book and game store. In April of 2005 Tina found that a local bookstore was going to be closing its doors, and after convincing Tim of taking a chance on the idea, they put together a business plan, bought the stock of the other book shop, and set about making at least part of their dream a reality.</p>

				<p>Opening as Here Be Books in August of that same year, the shop was stocked with over 40,000 books. Gradually they began hosting events and building a community to attend them. These included book signings, read-a-longs, Dungeons & Dragons game days, and monthly game nights beginning in 2007.</p>

				<p>They noticed that customers who attended the game nights would often go out later to buy their own copies of the games they had played. Deciding it would be a good move to provide games that people could buy right there, Tim and Tina finally fulfilled the other half of their initial dream and began selling tabletop games alongside their books.</p>

				<p>After 12 years in business, however, they were forced into a tough position as a suddenly quadrupled rent rate meant that the continued existence of their shop was suddenly in jeopardy. Selling off most of their books, they closed the original location and moved to another nearby with a greater focus on being a game shop and gaming salon where people can buy and play games and socialize face-to-face. They continue to hold their monthly Game Nights every first Saturday and have free open gaming on Wednesdays, with other gaming events on the remaining Saturdays and a book club on every second Friday.</p>
